# Dynamic-Hand-Gesture-Recognition
It is a computer vision based project that recognizes the dynamic hand gestures from video frames using factorized 3D CNN. We used the NVIDIA dynamic hand gesture dataset (also known as nvGesture) for this.  This repository contains the structure of the dataset, code for preprocessing video data, training the model, and visualizing the results.
